# Security Guidelines for Equinox Application

## Environment Variables Setup

1. **Create a `.env` file** (copy from `.env.template`):
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

2. **Set your environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure secret key
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
   
   # Add your OpenAI API key
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-openai-api-key"
   ```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. API Key Management
- **NEVER** commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure credential management
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity

### 2. Flask Security
- Use strong secret keys (minimum 32 bytes)
- Enable CSRF protection for forms
- Implement rate limiting
- Use HTTPS in production

### 3. Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize file uploads
- Implement file type restrictions
- Limit file upload sizes

### 4. Error Handling
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Log errors securely
- Implement proper exception handling

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Debug mode disabled
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Database connections secured
- [ ] File upload restrictions implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Error monitoring setup
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Input validation in place

## Monitoring and Alerts

- Monitor API usage and costs
- Set up alerts for unusual activity
- Log all security events
- Regular security audits

## Emergency Response

If you suspect a security breach:
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Check logs for suspicious activity
3. Review recent code changes
4. Contact your security team
5. Document the incident
